## About the project
### Problem:
90% of the worldâ€™s Cacao used mainly for chocolate manufacturing, comes from tiny farms of less than one hectare, with old trees and very low yields that do not allow cocoa farming households to raise incomes above extreme poverty. That fact is also true in Venezuela. Known for a unique flavor which is sought after by luxury chocolatiers. The chocolate industry is faced with structural supply issues. Demand is growing rapidly and Cacao prices are at record highs. At the same time, confectioners have pledged to source certified and sustainable Cacao, at least in part because of scandals over child labor on West African farms. Given these challenges, low yields, inefficient intermediaries, and poor access to markets and finance, crops such as Cacao cannot compete economically with coca and other illegal activities. As a result, Venezuela is lacking progress in the quality of its Cacao and facing uncertainty for the future of Cacao Criollos.
